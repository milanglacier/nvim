# Features

## Modern Devtools Integration

Built on modern devtools including LSP and treesitter. Treesitter delivers
AST-level highlighting, text objects, and navigations, while LSP offers
features like auto completion, go to definition and reference, and code
diagnostics. By harnessing the power of both Ctags and LSP, this configuration
brings a harmonic blend of old-school and modern development tools.

## Powerful Text Edit Plugins

Vim's exceptional text editing capabilities are further amplified by a host of
powerful plugins focusing on text editing. (Remember it is pure text editing
makes vim vim.)

## Tailored for Data Science

This configuration is specifically tailored toward data science toolsets,
including python, R, SQL, Latex, rmarkdown, and quarto.

## Seamless Integration with Vscode

Curated configuration working together with vscode thanks to
[vscode-neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim). Access all the
familiar neovim keybindings, including translations of equivalent commands in
vscode, even when working with complex graphical content like Jupyter
notebooks. And many neovim plugins, such as treesitter, can be embedded
seamlessly in vscode, allowing for a smooth and uninterrupted workflow.

**NOTE**: If you plan to use this configuration with `vscode-neovim`, please
use the `vscode` branch. If you wish to use neovim both in the terminal
and in vscode, we suggest creating two folders in `~/.config` or your specified
`$XDG_CONFIG` path. One is `~/.config/nvim`, which uses the default
configuration in the `master` branch, and the other is
`~/.config/vscode-neovim`, which uses the configuration in the `vscode`
branch. This takes advantage of the `NVIM_APPNAME` feature in `nvim 0.9`.

Then, Set `vscode-neovim.NVIM_APPNAME` to `vscode-neovim` in vscode settings.

## Be Wild

Randomly select a theme from a curated list each time you start up and
automatically switches between day and night themes at scheduled time.
Additionally, the displayed verses on the welcome screen is also randomized with
each launch. With neovim, you can have a fresh experience every time. Be casual
and wild!

# Showcase

![welcome-screen](assets/welcome-screen.png)

- The welcome screen displays two verses randomly selected from my curated
  collection. You can select new verses and color schemes at random or access
  frequently used commands from this screen.

![lsp](./assets/lsp-ctags.png)

- This screenshot showcases writing Lua code with smart autocompletion through
  both language server (LSP) and universal-ctags (ctags). This combination
  seamlessly blends old-school and modern tools. The bottom window shows the
  occurrence of referenced symbols that you specify (via `lsp find references`), while the right window shows the symbol outline of the current
  file (via `lsp document symbols`).

![literate-programming](./assets/literate-programming.png)

- This screenshot demonstrates the use of literate programming in neovim, which
  is highly beneficial for data science workflows. You can write code in both
  Python and R with intelligent autocompletion from both LSP and Ctags in quarto
  or markdown files. Moreover, you can send your code to both R and Python REPL
  simultaneously.

![dap](./assets/dap-python.png)

- This screenshot demonstrates how to debug Python program in neovim. Stepping through
  the code and watching variables and stack frames, just like in vscode.

# Dependencies

You are responsible for installing the dependencies, but most of them are
optional. They consist mainly of language servers and linters that correspond
to their respective languages. You can choose the ones you need and leave out
the others. Even if certain dependencies are absent, neovim will still operate
and display notifications instead of halting completely.

If your system lacks a proper package manager, such as with Windows, or if the
packages are out of date, as with Debian, you can use `Mason.nvim`, a neovim
plugin specifically to install some of the dependencies. Dependencies marked
with a `*` can be installed through `Mason.nvim`. To install these packages
within neovim, enter `:Mason` in the prompt, and a popup window will appear
with the intuitive interface of `Mason`. From there, you can easily install
packages.

This configuration relies on an external tool called `efm-langserver`, which
can be installed via `mason`. However, it needs to be separately configured
outside of neovim. An example configuration for `efm` is provided in the `dist`
folder. To use this example configuration, simply copy the folder to
`~/.config/`.

## python deps

1. `python`.
2. `debugpy`: this module should be included by the `python` at the top of your `$PATH`.
3. `ipython`
4. `black*`
5. `efm-langserver*`
6. `basedpyright*`

## r deps

1. `r-language-server`: this is a R package that should be installed by the `r` at the top of your `$PATH`
2. `radian`

## lua deps

1. `lua-language-server*`
2. `stylua*`
3. `selene*`
4. `efm-langserver*`

## vimscript deps

1. `vim-language-server*`

## markdown deps

1. `prettierd*`
2. `vale*`
3. `efm-langserver*`

## sql deps

1. `sqls*`
2. `sql-formatter*`

## bash deps

1. `bash-language-server*`
2. `shellcheck*`

## latex deps

1. `texlab*`
2. `latexindent*`: while this package is shipped with `texlive`, `perl` shipped
   by macOS cannot run this program, so I use a `homebrew` installed
   `latexindent` instead.

## cpp deps

1. `clangd*`: Apple's `xcode` command line tools ship this for you.

## general purpose deps

1. `universal-ctags`
2. `treesitter-cli*`: this is required for `nvim-treesitter` in `main` branch.
3. `lazygit`: this is only required if want to use `lazygit` in neovim (which is binded to `<leader>og`).

# Keymaps

NOTE: this only includes keymaps defined by myself,
and some of the default plugins keymaps
that I used frequently.

The `<Leader>` key is `<Space>`,
the `<LocalLeader>` key is `<Space><Space>` or `<Backslash>`.

In case you forget the keymaps
you can always use `<Leader>fk` (`:Telescope keymaps`)
to find all keymaps.

# Other Notes

1. `vim-sneak` defines relatively inconsistent behavior: in normal mode,
   use `s/S`, in operator pending mode, use `z/Z`, in visual mode,
   use `s/Z`. In normal mode, default mapping `s` is replaced.
   In op mode, use `z/Z` is to be compatible with `vim-surround` (mappings: `ys/ds/cs`),
   in visual mode, use `s/Z` is to be compatible with
   folding (mapping: `zf`) and `vim-surround` (mapping: `S`)

2. You need to define your leader key before defining any keymaps.
   Otherwise, keymap will not be correctly mapped with your leader key.

3. `vim-matchup` will (intentionally) hide the status-line if the matched pair are spanned
   over entire screen to show the other side of the pair.

1. It is recommended to use the mailing list `~northyear/nvim-devel@lists.sr.ht`.
